    <h2>Time Period: </h2>
    <p>The Vedic period lasted from around 1500 BCE to 500 BCE.
        It is divided into early Vedic (Rigveda, c. 1500–1000 BCE) and later Vedic (composed after 1000 BCE) periods.</p>
        <h3>   Vedic Texts:</h3>
        <ul >
      <li>Rigveda: The oldest and most important Veda, a collection of hymns.</li>
        <li>Yajurveda: Contains sacrificial formulas and rituals.</li>
        <li>Samaveda: A collection of chants and melodies for rituals.</li>
        <li>Atharvaveda: Includes hymns, spells, and knowledge for daily life</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Language and Literature:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Sanskrit language became the basis of Vedic texts. </li>
            <li>Apart from the Vedas, other important texts like the Brahmanas (rituals), Aranyakas (theological discussions), and Upanishads (philosophical teachings) were written during this period.  </li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>Transition to Settled Agriculture: The later Vedic period saw the rise of more settled life, with the establishment of larger cities and states.
            Bhagavad Gita and other philosophical texts began to emerge towards the end of the Vedic period.
            Social and religious practices became more complex, and rituals and sacrifices grew more elaborate. </p>
