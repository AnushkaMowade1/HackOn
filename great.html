        <p>The Great Empires of Ancient India played a vital role in shaping 
            the history and culture of the Indian subcontinent. The Maurya Empire (c. 322–185 BCE), founded by Chandragupta Maurya, established one of the largest empires in Indian history, with Ashoka the Great expanding it to its greatest territorial extent. Ashoka’s conversion to Buddhism and his promotion of non-violence marked a significant cultural shift. Following the Mauryas, the Gupta Empire (c. 320–550 CE) ushered in a Golden Age, with advancements in science, mathematics, and arts, and the flourishing of Hinduism and Buddhism. The Chola Empire (9th–13th centuries CE), centered in southern India, was known for its naval power, cultural contributions, and extensive trade in the Indian Ocean. </p>
