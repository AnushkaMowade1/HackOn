    <h2> North Indian Kingdoms – The Rajputs</h2>
    <p>The Medieval Indian History period lies between 
        the 8th and the 18th century A.D. Ancient Indian history came to an end with the rule of Harsha and Pulakesin II.</p>
        <h3>The medieval period can be divided into two stages:</h3>
        <ul >
        <li>Early medieval period: 8th – 12th century A.D.</li>
        <li>Later Medieval period: 12th-18th century.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About the Rajputs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Origin of Rajputs is a subject of debate. There are many theories that support their origins such
                 as the Agni Kula theory, Tribal Origin theory, Foreign Origin theory, Kshatriya Origin theory, and mixed origin theory.</li>
            <li>Rajputs belonged to the early medieval period.</li>
            <li>The Rajput Period (647A.D- 1200 A.D.)</li>
            <li>From the death of Harsha to the 12th century, the destiny of India was mostly in the hands of various Rajput dynasties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Rajput kingdom proved to be a very big difficulty to the whole Muslim conquest of Hindu India, during the period of Islamic invasions from 11th to 16th centuries. During the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556-1605 CE), Mughal authority was accepted by Rajput & were allowed into the emperor’s court. They were given status in his administration & forces & also formed martial & martial associations with the Emperor.
            Prithviraj Chauhan is the most prominent ruler of Rajputana dynasty. After the death of his father he ascended the seat at a small age of thirteen.
            He was known for his skilled archery that he could aim based only on sound and did not even look at his target. In between he raised his territory and organized most of the Rajasthan and Haryana unifying Rajput against Muslim attacks. A Muslim defeater called Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori became threat to Prithviraj & his territories as he was capturing nearby empires. Prithvi Raj was defeated & captured at the second battle of Tarain. He was tortured & his eyes were blinded by red hot iron rods. Afterward, in an archery rivalry he exhibited his talent by striking targets. Ghori said to be has acclaimed for his accomplishment on hearing his voice, Prithvi Raj aimed an arrow in his direction killing him over.

Another famous ruler was Maharana Pratap. He was King of Mewar and was regarded as a fearless warrior & ingenious strategist, who successfully fought the Mughals & safeguard his people until his death. Slowly the power of Rajput declined as there was no match for the supremacy of Mughals.

When the British arrived in India, the Rajput states become colonies which in turn ended the reign of Rajputs forever. After India’s independence (1947), most of the Rajput states in Rajputana were merged to form the state of Rajasthan within the Indian union.
