    <h2> Mamluk dynasty (1206–90)</h2>
    <p>After the death of Muhammad of Ghur in 1206, the first dynasty of the Delhi sultanate was established. This line of rulers
         was founded by Muhammad of Ghur’s enslaved lieutenant Qutb al-Din Aibak (or Aybak). In eastern Muslim states of the time, enslaved young men who were capable and talented were often trained to be loyal soldiers and to serve in high government posts.</p>
        <h3> Mamluk dynasty (also known as the Slave dynasty).</h3>
        <ul >
        <li>Qutb al-Din Aibak had been one of Muhammad’s most trusted military commanders and had overseen his conquests in India.</li>
        <li> After Qutb’s death, he was succeeded by his son-in-law and ablest general, Iltutmish, who ruled from 1211 to 1236.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Khalji dynasty (1290–1320)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The second ruling line of the Delhi sultanate was the Khalji dynasty. Like the Mamluk dynasty, the Khaljis were a tribe of Turkish origin that had settled in Afghanistan. </li>
            <li>Khalji rulers, the Delhi sultanate briefly became an empire. At the time, Delhi was one of the largest cities in the whole of the Islamic world. </li>
            <li>The Khalji dynasty was founded when Jalal al-Din Firuz Khalji seized power in 1290.</li>
        <li>In 1296 he was killed by his ambitious nephew and successor, Juna Khan. Juna Khan then ruled with the title ʿAlaʾ al-Din Khalji until his death in 1316.</li></ul>
        <p>ʿAlaʾ al-Din expanded and enriched the state with his many military conquests. He conquered Gujarat about 1297 and the principal fortified places in Rajasthan in 1301–12. After several
             raids into southern India (the Deccan), the main Hindu chiefs of the region formally recognized the supremacy of the sultanate. The sultanate plundered gold and other wealth and received more treasure as tribute from the conquered rulers. It then used these riches to finance further military campaigns. ʿAlaʾ al-Din also fended off several Mongol attacks during his reign.
